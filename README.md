# Rails App

- Began designing lists on Trello
- Wrote through project idea, discussed project pain points, MVP, 
- We worked in a group to run ideas by each other, brainstorm ideas to add on, 
- We then created the user stories
- I went back over my user stories, and picked out the main points to develop
- I'm working on a map represting my user journey - designed in Figma
- Working on user journeys
- Researching website and mobile layouts for app
- Started designing lo fi wireframes - designed several
- Started to design ERD/Models
- Got those approved
- Finished designing lo fi
- Browsed Pinterest and google for website inspiration
- Now designing hi fi
- Researched and designed logo and brainstormed ideas for store name

Devise 
- To check user at checkout, use 'if user_signed_in?' and redirect path, then aftr user signed in redirect back to page


## Things to remember 
- Want to take what is usually a complicated process, storage, and make it as simple as possible
- Inspired by Uber - one click order process
- Layouts like Airbnb
- Also wanted to restrict user choice greatly to keep process simple
- - Only really a couple outcomes for website, funnel them towards those
- -  Make it so that can almost do away with menu
- As few clicks as possible - as few webpages as possible - few redirections - use of modals for that purpose

## User Stories

Issues that were raised on user stories:

### Buyers

- Is the location secure/lockable? (an optional extra)
- Want cheaper storage rates
- Want to know size of space - dimensions
- List storage locations on map - can view one closest to me/closest to where I need the storage, search process is easier
- Want to know if storage site has vehicle access
- Want to know location
- Does space have external access so I can retrieve things anytime/without distrubing owner
- Time of access to things (24/7)?

## Sellers

- Extra storage, want to offer space to those who require it, for a price
- Possibly ability to charge higher rates depending on ease of access, lockability (user access only lock?) etc
- Show location, but not exact address unless buyer is signed in
- Ability to generate passive/secondary stream of income
- Generate income off unused asset
- Ability to arrange how user can access their stuff, will I be there? - Reduce hassle
- Legal implcations - payment/not picking up things/late 
- Ability to list times the user can access my property

## Viewers

- Want to be able to view available storage without signing up - know if website is worth it
- Want to only have to sign up is actually purchasing storage

## Owner/Admin/Marketplace

- Want to ensure there is proper security for users - protect sensitive information like names and addresses
- Want the ability to delete users - violating terms of privacy/use
- Want to post updates on website
- Want to be able to contact any user when necessary
